Ads Several build pieces including roofs, walls, windows, trees (placeable not plantable), and many more.
to use you must have Jotunn the Valheim Lib. Install it as directed by the JVL mod page, then install Build It.
To build the items you will need the Improved Hammer that can be made at the workbench. (prefab ID rk_hammer)
This mod can be used with Precise rotation as is, and Gizmo reloaded by adding "ImprovedHammer" in the config (this may have changed and be supported by default, check the mod description).
Build It is compatible with the Build Camera uploaded by CookieMilk on Thunderstore.
More items coming soon!
